**Problem:** 
The project is about different classification and regression techniques. There are six sub-problems under this project.
- Experiment with `Gaussian Discriminators` by implementing Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Linear Regression implementation
- Experiment with Ridge Regression
- Using Gradient Descent for Ridge Regression
- Non-linear Regression
- Compare and interpret the results of different classification and regression methods
